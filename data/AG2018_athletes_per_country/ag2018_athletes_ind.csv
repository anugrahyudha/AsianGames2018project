""It\'s really disappointing. It\'s not just because I can\'t shoot double trap at the Olympics, but because the effort that I have put in and the time that I have given to this discipline over the past seven or eight years won\'t give me anything now. One decision and that\'s changed everything for me. That\'s what hurts the most. But I can\'t afford to cry over that. I have to take this decision in my stride and try to find a place for myself somewhere else. Many shooters across the world have already moved on and are trying their hand at trap or skeet.
