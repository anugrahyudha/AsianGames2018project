""In my neighbourhood, people asked my parents to not let me wear shorts and play hockey. They felt I might bring a bad name to the family."" She asked her parents for one chance to prove herself, and they managed to enrol her at the Shahabad Hockey Academy.

The coach ignored the academy\'s rule not to admit any girl under the age of eight and allowed her to train. ""She was so gifted that I had to relax the rule for her, and I am glad I did,"" Singh said.
